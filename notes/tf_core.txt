tensors are sets of primitive values

3 # a rank 0 tensor; this is a scalar with shape []
[1. ,2., 3.] # a rank 1 tensor; this is a vector with shape [3]

[[1., 2., 3.], [4., 5., 6.]] # a rank 2 tensor; a matrix with shape [2, 3]
#Big list has 2 items, smaller list has 3 items

[[[1., 2., 3.]], [[7., 8., 9.]]] # a rank 3 tensor with shape [2, 1, 3]
#Big list has two items, middle list has one item, small list has 3 items

Computational graph is a graph of nodes
Constants are nodes: they take no inputs and output the value stored internally

tf.constant initializes variables immediately and values don't changes
variables are not initialized with tf.Variable, need to specifically intiialize
